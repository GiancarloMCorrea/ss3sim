\section{\code{change_f_par()}}{

Early versions of ss3sim used the par file to control parameter values.
It was easier to maintain ss3sim and implement features using the control
file as more functionality was included in r4ss to read and write the
control file compared to the par file. Thus, ss3sim will use the control
file as much as possible going forward. Functions were being maintained
for both the control and par files with _par added after the function
name for those pertaining to the par file. Starting with ss3sim version
1.1.6, this dual functionality was deprecated and only control file
manuipulation will be supported going forward.
