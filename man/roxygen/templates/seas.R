#' @param seas A list the same length as \code{fleets}. The list should contain
#' either single numeric values or numeric vectors, where the length of each
#' vector matches the length of each vector present in \code{years}.
#' Single values are repeated for all years.
#' This parameter operates the same as \code{sds_obs} but it specifies the
#' season rather than the standard deviation of the observations.
