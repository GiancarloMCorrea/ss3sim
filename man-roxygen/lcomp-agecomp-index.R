#' @param fleets *A numeric vector giving the fleets to be used. This order also
#' pertains to other arguments. A missing value excludes that fleet from
#' \code{outfile} (i.e. it turns it off so no samples are written). If none of
#' the fleet collected samples, keep the value to \code{fleets=NULL}.
#' @param years *A list the same length as \code{fleets} giving the years as
#' numeric vectors. If no fleet collected samples, keep the value to
#' \code{years=NULL}.
